# Welcome! üíó

Thanks for stopping by my Full-Stack Web Development Organization! I created this organization to document all of my work and progress throughout the Columbia Engineering Full-Stack Boot Camp in 2024.

## About

The purpose of this organization is not just to organize my repositories in a way that makes sense to me, but also to give specific meaning to my accomplishments throughout my time as a student. The goal of this organization is to showcase the progress that I've made in six months, as well as serve as reference material that I can refer back to in future endeavors.

## Topics

Every repository is labeled with Topics, which I use to further organize the organization. The topics are categorized by type, and each type holds a specific meaning:

* **üìù Assignment:** Repositories that contain an Assignment Topic indicate a project that was completed. They include:
  
  * `Weekly-Challenges`
  * `Mini-Projects`
  * `Group-Projects`
  * `Algorithms`

* **üåê Language:** Repositories can contain one or more Language Topics. Each denotes a programming language that is used to within, or referred to by, the codebase.

* **üíª Module:** Repositories that contain a Module Topic indicate notes, code snippets, or other documentation that pertains to a certain week's lesson. An example of a Module Topic is `Module-11`.
